I'll be writing a bunch of card game variants and hope to eventually factor out an engine that's useful for quickly implenting new card games
Current Status

Klondike works
    needs front end
Hearts does not work
    front end
    split into modules
    needs server
    maybe 
        -- stop computing scores along the way and store tricks, then compute
        at round end
        -- ai can be better for testing (if can dodge trick, throw points. If
        can't win big)
        -- revamp info with lenses
        -- quickCheck isValidPlay
        -- make some sort of monady thing that ensures player input is always validated
