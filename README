I'll be writing a bunch of card game variants and hope to eventually factor out an engine that's useful for quickly implenting new card games
Current Status

Klondike works
    needs front end
Hearts does not work
    needs passing to be implemented
    needs rounds to end and proceed properly
        check for shooting the moon, check to see if game over
    ensure hearts can't be lead until broken
    needs server? ai for testing (just play first valid card)
