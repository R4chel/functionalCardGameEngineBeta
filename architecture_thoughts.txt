from engines point of view 
server should be defined by 
    A message format
    A function that interprets those messages

A)
once game is started, with each player share a box for passing messages
data Message = ClientToServer | ServerToClient
data ClientToServer = MoveCard Card Zone Zone | MakeSelection Selection | Resign | EndTurn | Etc
data ServerToClient = GetMove | GetResponse | GetInfo | GameOver | ReportStateChange

maybe pass rendering directives along a separate channel?

player_client should
    connect to server
    fork rendering thread
    fork input thread
    send messages to server upon valid input
    render in response to state change
